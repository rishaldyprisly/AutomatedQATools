Test Case Automation Tool (W/o binding elements)

I created this script to test web interface without element binding like Selenium.
It only automating your cursor and keyboard to fill the forms, like a bot.
I suggest you to use selenium, then why i created this script?
If you only have a very low spec pc, or raspberry py but you can't use powerfull softwae to do some test case, using pyautogui as your main library is not as bad as you think.

Cheers.
